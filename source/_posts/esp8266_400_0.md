# ESP8266 AT Mode Connect Error returning 400 bad request by cloudflare 
### Problem Reproduction
This project is using ESP8266 to sending GET request to the custom URL by AT mode
but the response are not correct while doing the API requests.
---

* Response 
```html
<html><head><title>400 Bad Request</title></head><body><center><h1>400 Bad Request</h1></center><hr><center>cloudflare</center></body></html>
```

### Solution 
* After finding time on how to fix, I changed to other way to call the api and it started working after that
```c
    esp8266_send_cmd("AT+CIPMODE=1", "OK", 100); // Enable transparent transmission
    esp8266_send_cmd("AT+CIPSEND", "OK", 100);   // Start transparent transmission

    sprintf((char *)command, "GET /api/getuserstatus?username=%s HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: elec3300.marcoko.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n", username);
```
And it works for no reasons 

Also remember to turn off these Settings in *Cloudflare* if you don't want to add more headers to ESP requests 

- Security -> Settings -> Browser Integrity Check : Off
- Security -> Settings -> Security Level : Off
- SSL/TLS -> Overview -> SSL/TLS encryption : Flexible / Off (Choose one)
- DNS -> Records -> turn off the cloudflare proxies of the corresponding baseUrl
